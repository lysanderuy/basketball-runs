## Data Flow — One Direction Only

```
UI (pages/components)
  → fetch /api/...
    → app/api/**/route.ts       validate with Zod, call service
      → services/               business logic, no HTTP knowledge
        → lib/db/               Drizzle queries only
```

**Never skip a layer.** UI never imports from `services/`. Services never import from `app/`. API routes never contain business logic — they validate and delegate.

**Exception:** Server Components may read from Supabase directly for page data fetching. Writes always go through API routes.

---

## What Goes Where

### API routes (`app/api/`)
- Validate request body with Zod (`safeParse` — never `parse`)
- Call a service function
- Return `NextResponse.json()`
- No DB queries directly in route handlers

### Services (`services/`)
- All DB queries live here
- No `NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, or any HTTP concept
- No Zod — validation happens in API routes before services are called
- Pure functions: take typed inputs, return typed outputs

### Lib (`lib/`)
- `lib/db/schema.ts` — table definitions only, no queries
- `lib/db/index.ts` — Drizzle client only
- `lib/validations/` — Zod schemas only
- `lib/utils.ts` — pure utility functions (cn, formatTime, etc.)

### Types (`types/`)
- `types/db.ts` — only `$inferSelect` and `$inferInsert` from Drizzle tables
- No manually written interfaces that duplicate the schema

### Hooks (`hooks/`)
- Client-side only (`"use client"` context)
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions live here
- No direct DB access — hooks call API routes or subscribe via Realtime

## Auth Model

| Role | Account | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Host | Required | Full control — create run, manage queue, score, clock |
| Player | Guest (optional) | Join queue, view live score |
| Spectator | Guest | Read-only |

- `(protected)/layout.tsx` guards all host-only pages
- Middleware (`lib/supabase/proxy.ts`) provides early redirect for `/create-run`, `/history`, `/account`
- RLS enforces authorization at the DB level — do not re-implement access checks in services
- Guest mutations (join queue) go through API routes — RLS `WITH CHECK (true)` allows them

---

## Schema Rules

These are non-negotiable — violations break the app silently.

- **`games.score_a` and `games.score_b` are trigger-maintained.** Never write them from application code. Only `score_events` inserts/voids affect them.
- **Queue ordering is a linked list.** Order is encoded via `queue_entries.after_entry_id` (NULL = head). Never use integer positions or ORDER BY `joined_at` to determine queue order.
- **Never hard-delete `queue_entries` with game history.** `game_players` and `score_events` have `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on `queue_entry_id`. Always set `status = 'removed'` instead.
- **`users.id` mirrors `auth.users.id`.** The row is created by trigger, not by the app. Never insert into `users` manually.
- **`session_code` is the public identifier for a run.** URLs use `[code]` not `[id]`.

---

## Migration Rules

```bash
# Schema change (new table, new column, index):
npm run db:generate        # drizzle-kit diffs schema → writes SQL to supabase/migrations/
# review the generated file
npm run db:push            # supabase db push — applies all pending migrations

# RLS / trigger change:
# write SQL manually to supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_description.sql
npm run db:push
```

- **Never run `drizzle-kit migrate`** — it bypasses Supabase and creates a separate migration history
- **Never edit a migration file after it has been applied** — write a new one
- Drizzle generates table/index/FK SQL. RLS policies and triggers are always hand-written SQL
- Migration files apply in alphabetical order — naming must be sequential

---

## Zod Usage

```ts
// In API routes — always use safeParse, never parse
const result = createRunSchema.safeParse(await req.json())
if (!result.success) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: result.error.flatten() }, { status: 400 })
}
// result.data is now typed and safe to pass to a service
```

- All schemas live in `lib/validations/index.ts`
- Export both the schema and the inferred type: `export type CreateRunInput = z.infer<typeof createRunSchema>`
- Enum values in Zod schemas must match the Drizzle enum values exactly

---

## Supabase Realtime

- Realtime subscriptions belong in `hooks/` — never in Server Components or API routes
- Subscribe to the `games` table for live score updates (the trigger keeps it in sync)
- Subscribe to `queue_entries` for live queue updates
- Always unsubscribe on component unmount — use the `useEffect` cleanup return

---

## What NOT To Do

- Do not use `drizzle-kit migrate` — use `supabase db push`
- Do not write to `games.score_a` or `games.score_b` from app code
- Do not hard-delete queue entries — set `status = 'removed'`
- Do not query `lib/db/` from inside `app/` pages or components
- Do not put business logic in API route handlers — put it in `services/`
- Do not use `z.parse()` in API routes — always `z.safeParse()`
- Do not add Zod validation inside services — services trust their inputs
- Do not use integer rank columns for queue ordering — the linked list is the order
- Do not create new files unless the task requires it
- Do not add comments explaining what code does — only add comments explaining why when the reason is non-obvious
