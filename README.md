# BallRuns

BallRuns is the sideline tool for running pickup basketball. Hosts manage queues, run games, and track scores in real time — while players just show up and play.

## What is BallRuns?

BallRuns keeps the chaos out of pickup basketball. Hosts create a run and share a 6-character code. Players scan in, join the queue, and wait their turn. The host assigns teams, scores points, and runs the clock — all from their phone. Everyone sees the same live state without refreshing.

## Core Principles

**Host-first design.** The host is managing a game on a court, not sitting at a desk. Every action should be fast and obvious.

**Real-time by default.** Queue changes and score updates push to all connected clients instantly. Nobody should be looking at stale state.

**Zero friction for players.** Players join with a name and a code — no account, no download, no friction.

**Scores are events, not edits.** Every point is logged as a `score_events` row. Undo doesn't delete — it voids. The record stays intact and a trigger keeps `games.score_a` / `score_b` in sync.

**Queue order is explicit.** Order is an integer `position` column maintained by a database trigger on game completion. The host never sorts by timestamp.

## Who Should Use BallRuns

**Run organizers.** People who host recurring pickup sessions and want structure without spreadsheets.

**Gym and court managers.** Anyone managing a rotating queue of teams across multiple games.

**Casual groups.** Friend groups who want a fair, visible queue instead of "who called next?"

## Key Features

**Session codes.** Share a 6-character `session_code` (shown as `ABC-DEF`) to bring players into your run — no accounts needed on their end.

**Live queue management.** Add players, reorder the queue, mark players out, or pull them back — with changes reflected instantly for everyone via Supabase Realtime.

**Team assignment.** Pick who plays before each game starts. Drag from the queue directly into Team A or Team B.

**Live scoreboard.** Log points by team. Undo any point without losing the audit trail — `score_events` is voided, not deleted.

**Game clock.** Optional countdown timer with pause and resume. Paused time is tracked separately so the clock stays accurate.

**Run formats.** Supports Winner Stays, New Ten, and Host Decides formats. The DB trigger rotates the queue according to the run's format on game completion.

**Run settings.** Score goal, point system (1s-and-2s or 2s-and-3s), and an optional time limit are chosen once at run creation and applied to every game in the run.

**Court fees.** The host can mark each player paid from the payment view — tracked per queue entry, independent of their queue status.

**Game history.** Every game, team lineup, and point event is stored. Past games are always viewable from the lobby.

| ORM | Drizzle ORM |
| Migrations | `node-pg-migrate` (JS builder API) |
| Validation | Zod |
| HTTP envelope | `src/lib/api/` + `src/types/api.ts` |

## Project Structure

The layout reads **frontend in `app/`, infra in `lib/`, persistence in `db/`**. Drizzle is not under `lib/` — it has its own top-level tree. Zod schemas live in `validators/`, never inside services or routes.

## Data Flow

One direction only — never skip a layer.

```
page / client component
  │  TanStack Query hook (src/hooks/use-<thing>.ts)
  ▼
api wrapper (src/lib/api/client.ts)        ← single source of HTTP from the browser
  │  ApiResponse<T> envelope
  ▼
route handler (src/app/api/**/route.ts)    ← thin: auth + Zod + delegate
  │                                          responds with apiSuccess / apiError
  ▼
service (src/services/<thing>.service.ts)  ← ALL business logic + DB access
  │
  ▼
db (src/db, Drizzle) / Supabase
```

**Strict layer rules — no exceptions for app data:**

- **Client components NEVER import from `src/services`, `src/db`, or `src/lib/supabase/{client,proxy}`.** They reach the backend only through `src/hooks` → the api wrapper.
- **Server Components NEVER import from `src/services` or `src/db`.** They reach the backend only through `fetch('/api/...')` parsed as the `ApiResponse<T>` envelope. There is no Server-Component shortcut.
- **Route handlers stay thin:** authenticate (`createClient()` from `src/lib/supabase/server` + `auth.getUser()`), validate with Zod (`safeParse` — never `parse`), delegate to a service, respond with `apiSuccess` / `apiError` / `handleApiError` from `src/lib/api/response.ts`. No business logic, no DB queries, no direct Drizzle.
- **Services own ALL business logic and DB access.** They never touch `Request` / `Response` / `cookies`. They take plain typed inputs (including the authenticated `userId`) and scope every query to that user. Validation does not live here — services trust their inputs.
- **Auth exception:** `src/app/(auth)/actions.ts` calls the Supabase SDK directly to manage auth cookies. It is the only place outside `lib/supabase/` allowed to do so. **App data never uses the Supabase SDK directly.**

**State boundaries:**

- API data → TanStack Query (`src/hooks`). Invalidate on Realtime events; never mirror into `useState` or Zustand.
- UI-only state → Zustand (`src/stores`). Drafts, toasts, drag previews — never API payloads.
- Auth context for the current session → `useSessionUser` hook (TanStack Query, `staleTime: Infinity`).

## Schema Highlights

These invariants are enforced in the database and must be respected by application code:

- **`games.score_a` and `games.score_b` are trigger-maintained.** Never write them from app code — only `score_events` inserts/voids change them.
- **Queue ordering is the integer `position` column.** Read with `ORDER BY position ASC`. Never sort by `joined_at`.
- **Queue rotation is trigger-maintained.** `trg_rotate_queue_on_game_complete` rewrites `queue_entries.position` on every game → `completed` transition. Never rotate the queue from app code.
- **Never hard-delete `queue_entries` with game history.** `game_players` and `score_events` have `ON DELETE RESTRICT`. Set `status = 'removed'` instead.
- **`users.id` mirrors `auth.users.id`.** The row is created by trigger, not by the app.
- **`session_code` is the public identifier for a run.** URLs use `[code]`, not `[id]`.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Supabase credentials (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `DIRECT_URL`)

3. Apply the database migrations
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

App runs at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Migrations

Drizzle Kit is **not used**. Migrations are JS files in `db/migrations/` (project root — not under `src/`), applied via `node-pg-migrate` against `DIRECT_URL`. `src/db/` is the Drizzle source-of-truth only.

```bash
# Scaffold a new migration
npm run db:migrate:create -- <description>

# Apply pending migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Roll back the last migration
npm run db:migrate:down
```

- Never edit a migration file after it has been applied — write a new one.
- Keep `src/db/schema/<table>.ts` in sync with migration changes manually.
- RLS policies and triggers go in migration files using `pgm.sql()`.
- `supabase/migrations/` contains legacy SQL files (already applied) — do not touch.
- Runner script: `tools/run-pg-migrate.mjs` — loads `DIRECT_URL` from `.env`.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server on `0.0.0.0:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript without emitting |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `npm run db:migrate:down` | Roll back the last migration |
| `npm run db:migrate:create -- <desc>` | Scaffold a new migration file |

## Auth Model

| Role | Account | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Host | Required | Full control — create run, manage queue, score, clock |
| Player | Guest (optional) | Join queue, view live score |
| Spectator | Guest | Read-only |

- `src/lib/supabase/proxy.ts` is the auth enforcement layer — it refreshes the session on every request and redirects unauthenticated users away from `/create-run`, `/history`, `/account`.
- `(protected)/layout.tsx` is a pure passthrough — do not add auth checks here.
- In API routes, authenticate with `createClient()` from `src/lib/supabase/server` + `auth.getUser()`. Pass the resolved `userId` to the service. The service scopes every query to that `userId` (or to a `runId` that the route has already resolved to be owned by `userId`).
- RLS enforces authorization at the DB level as a second line — do not re-implement access checks in services, but do pass `userId` in so the service can scope its queries.
- Guest mutations (join queue) go through API routes — RLS `WITH CHECK (true)` allows them.

## UI Priorities

This is a **mobile-first web app** — players use it on their phones at the court.

- Always design for mobile first. Tailwind: start with base (mobile) styles, add `md:` / `lg:` breakpoints only for desktop enhancement.
- Touch targets minimum 44px. Tap-friendly spacing.
- Bottom nav is the primary navigation — do not replace with sidebars or top-heavy layouts.
- Avoid hover-only interactions — use tap/press states.
- Desktop layout is a nice-to-have, not a requirement.
